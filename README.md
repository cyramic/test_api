# Health API

Please see the following documents

* [How to run this](./docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md) - This is the instructions on how to run this service and test it
* [A list of assumptions I made when designing](./docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md) - This is a list of assumptions I made while 
designing it, many of these would require a discussion with the team first or knowledge of existing libraries and tech
used by the team
* [Design Documentation](./docs/DESIGN.md) - This is a rough overview of how I feel the API should be hosted and
thoughts about the design of the API itself.
* [Next Steps](./docs/NEXT_STEPS.md) - As this is merely a prototype, this is where I discussed what the
next steps would be in designing something that could be better used in production. Where would I go next, and
what still needs doing
